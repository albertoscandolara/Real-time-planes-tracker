# Real-time-planes-tracker
This basic project serves as tracker for flying planes. 
Data come from [The OpenSky Network API](https://opensky-network.org/apidoc/index.html).
Only 10 planes are shown not to have an overcrowded map.

## Improvements
- new api
- new custom icons on markers

## Future improvements
- let the user decide how many planes to show on map
- let the user filter for flight number
- add a popup with info about the flight: flight number, departure, destination, delay/advance, speed...
- rotate the icon to match plane direction
- change icons acccording to airline company
- use external library to add animations
