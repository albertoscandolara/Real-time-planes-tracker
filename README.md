# Real-time-planes-tracker
This basic project serves as tracker for flying planes. 
Data come from [The OpenSky Network API](https://opensky-network.org/apidoc/index.html).
Only a finite number of planes is shown not to have an overcrowded map.

## Future improvements
- let the user decide how many planes to show on map
- let the user filter for flight number
- rotate the icon to match plane direction
